=head1 NAME

POE::Component::Client::MPD - a full-blown mpd client library


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use POE qw[ Component::Client::MPD ];
    POE::Component::Client::MPD->spawn( {
        host     => 'localhost',
        port     => 6600,
        password => 's3kr3t',  # mpd password
        alias    => 'mpd',     # poe alias
    } );

    # ... later on ...
    $_[KERNEL]->post( 'mpd', 'next' );


=head1 DESCRIPTION

POCOCM gives a clear message-passing interface (sitting on top of POE)
for talking to and controlling MPD (Music Player Daemon) servers. A
connection to the MPD server is established as soon as a new POCOCM
object is created.

Commands are then sent to the server as messages are passed.


=head1 PUBLIC PACKAGE METHODS

=head2 spawn( \%params )

This method will create a POE session responsible for communicating with mpd.
It will return the poe id of the session newly created.

You can tune the pococm by passing some arguments as a hash reference, where
the hash keys are:

=over 4

=item * host

The hostname of the mpd server. If none given, defaults to C<MPD_HOST>
environment variable. If this var isn't set, defaults to C<localhost>.


=item * port

The port of the mpd server. If none given, defaults to C<MPD_PORT>
environment variable. If this var isn't set, defaults to C<6600>.


=item * password

The password to sent to mpd to authenticate the client. If none given, defaults
to C<MPD_PASSWORD> environment variable. If this var isn't set, defaults to C<>.


=item * alias

An optional string to alias the newly created POE session.


=back


=head1 PUBLIC EVENTS

For a list of public events that you can send to a POCOCM session, check:

=over 4

=item *

C<POCOCM::Commands> for general commands

=item *

C<POCOCM::Playlist> for playlist-related commands

=item *

C<POCOCM::Collection> for collection-related commands

=back
